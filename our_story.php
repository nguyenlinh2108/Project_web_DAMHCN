					<h3>A World Of Real Chocolate Experiences</h3>

					<p>In my opinion, good chocolate is its own food group. A little bit feeds the soul and fires the imagination. I want people to experience the real thing, without lots of sugar, and other ingredients that most people confuse with the taste of chocolate. Real chocolate is strong, earthy, fruity, floral … a whole world that unfolds on your palate. It’s the deepest, densest tropical jungle mixed with the refinement of Paris and the sheer wonder of childhood. Chocolate, in all its mysteries and complexities, is my passion.<br>From what I’ve learned so far, what I believe is this:</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12">
					<ul>
						<li>Dark chocolate is more interesting because you get more of the real chocolate taste without lots of sugar.</li>
						<li>Single-origin chocolate is even more interesting because it takes on the flavors of the area where it was grown.</li>
						<li>Chocolate is an adventure; it comes from exotic locations, circling the equator, all around the globe.</li>
						<li>Don’t be shy about trying lots of chocolate. I try everything I can in order to explore all the varieties of flavor that the amazing theobroma cacao tree has to offer.</li>
						<li>There’s no right or wrong. If you like it, that’s great. If not, keep tasting and eat what you enjoy.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>As my business grows, it seems I’m drawn back, more and more, to the farm. In recent years, I’ve traveled to a few of the countries where cacao is grown. I’ve lived with the farmers and seen agroforestry and biodiversity in action. Although Seymour is half a world away from the jungles of Costa Rica, I’ve lived the farming life and I understand it.</p>
